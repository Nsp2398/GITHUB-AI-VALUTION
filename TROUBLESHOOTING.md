## üêõ Still Not Working?

### Check These Common Issues:

#### ‚úÖ Are the servers running?
Look for these two windows:
- **"ValuAI Backend"** - Should show Python server messages
- **"ValuAI Frontend"** - Should show Vite/React messages

#### ‚úÖ Check the URLs:
- ‚ùå Don't use: `localhost:5173`
- ‚úÖ Use: `127.0.0.1:5173`

#### ‚úÖ Wait longer:
- First startup can take 1-2 minutes
- Try refreshing the page after waiting

#### ‚úÖ Check your firewall:
- Windows might be blocking the connections
- Allow Node.js and Python through Windows Firewall
